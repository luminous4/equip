# Equip #

### A group collaboration tool with a customizable set of features to fit any group's needs. ###

Our app provides a user-friendly platform for collaboration for any kind of team. The team can choose from a variety of useful features such as a calendar, chat, photo gallery, team directory, agile board, and more to centralize and streamline their communication.

People have to work together in groups in all settings--work, recreation, school--and to manage those teams there are a number of small and simple applications spread across multiple platforms. It's tough to centralize contact and exchange.

Equip makes team workflow more efficient and fun! Everything is centered on your group and additional features are easily added and customized to fit your needs.
